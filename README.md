# MEAN Bookmarks

This project is a prototype bookmark manager based on the MEAN stack.  Still early in development, the goal is to support the following:

1. Add, edit, and remove bookmarks
2. Tag and categorise
3. "Open all" functionality

Further development will be considered once these objectives have been completed.
